            <p>
              Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a website. GilaniAI
              uses cookies and similar browser storage technologies (such as localStorage) to
              provide a reliable, personalised experience.

                <strong>Essential cookies:</strong> Required for the Service to function. Without
                these, features like login and session management would not work.

              <li>
                <strong>Preference cookies:</strong> Store your chosen settings (e.g. dark mode) so
                they persist between visits.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Functional cookies:</strong> Remember actions you've taken (e.g. dismissing
                the AI disclaimer) to avoid repetitive prompts.
              </li>
              <li>
