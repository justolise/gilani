        q: "What is GilaniAI?",
        a: "GilaniAI is an AI-powered study assistant built for students. It provides Socratic AI tutoring through chat — including quiz practice and note-based help directly in the conversation — plus real teacher escalation when you need a human to step in.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does GilaniAI have quizzes, notes, and a study planner?",
        a: "Yes. Beyond the AI tutor chat, GilaniAI includes a dedicated Quiz Generator for practice questions on any topic, a Notes tool that produces exhaustive AI summaries from uploaded PDFs, Word docs, images, or pasted text, and a Study Planner that builds a day-by-day schedule around your exam dates and subjects.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is GilaniAI free to use?",
        a: "Yes — GilaniAI is free to start. Create an account and get immediate access to the AI tutor chat and teacher escalation. Premium plans unlock higher daily message limits and priority escalation.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I create an account and sign in?",
        a: "Click 'Get started' or 'Sign in'. You can sign in with one click using 'Continue with Google', or enter your email address to receive a secure, 6-digit one-time verification code (OTP). GilaniAI is completely passwordless — no passwords to create or remember!",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need a password?",
        a: "No! GilaniAI uses passwordless authentication for maximum speed and security. You never have to create, remember, or reset a password. Just sign in with Google or your email OTP code.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I view public pages (Terms, Privacy, FAQ, About) without getting logged out?",
        a: "Yes. When you are signed in, public informational pages automatically display a 'Back' button to return to your previous session or settings, and a 'Dashboard' button to return directly to your app. You remain securely logged in at all times.",

      {
        q: "Where can I learn more about how GilaniAI works?",
        a: "You can visit our About page anytime from the website footer or directly from your user menu inside the app. It explains our pedagogical agents, curriculum grounding, and safety architecture.",

  {
    category: "AI Tutor",
    items: [
      {
        q: "How does the AI tutor work?",

      },
      {
        q: "Can the AI make mistakes?",
        a: "Yes. Like all AI systems, GilaniAI can occasionally produce inaccurate information. Always verify important answers with your teacher or official textbooks.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is the 'escalate to teacher' feature?",
        a: "If you're stuck or need human confirmation, you can escalate any study session to a real teacher. The teacher will review your conversation and leave a written response directly in GilaniAI.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does GilaniAI do my homework for me?",
        a: "GilaniAI is designed to guide your learning, not do your work for you. Using it to copy answers violates our Terms of Service and your school's academic integrity policy.",

      {
        q: "Can I delete my account and data?",
        a: "Yes. You have full self-service control. You can permanently delete your account and all associated study data at any time from your account Settings under the Consent & Security tab (Danger Zone). Alternatively, you can contact us at support@gilaniai.site.",

        q: "Does GilaniAI work offline?",

      },
      {
        q: "I signed up but haven't received my verification code (OTP). What should I do?",
        a: "Verification codes usually arrive in under a minute. Check your spam or promotions folder. If it hasn't arrived, click 'Resend' on the login screen after the cooldown countdown, or use 'Continue with Google' for instantaneous sign-in.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why is the AI response slow sometimes?",
        a: "Response speed depends on your internet connection and current server load. During peak hours responses may take a few extra seconds. If responses are consistently slow, try refreshing the page or switching to a faster network.",

      },
      {
        q: "Which subjects does GilaniAI cover?",
